/**
 * Public read seam of the tracking module (S16/T16-B). It is the only way to consult transport tracking:
 * nothing outside {@code tracking} may read the projection or the raw samples.
 *
 * <p>Two readings are offered, matching the two consumers of S16:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #latest} — the current <em>trusted</em> position and load state of a delivery (the projection
 *       that T17's geofence and any tracker UI consume);</li>
 *   <li>{@link #samples} — the chronological trail, ordered by the device clock ({@code recordedAt}) with
 *       {@code receivedAt}/{@code latestAdvanced} exposed, so a consumer can tell a late sample (arrived out
 *       of order) from one that actually moved the latest.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Tenancy is enforced by the caller (the REST adapter, as in T16-A): this seam answers for whatever
 * delivery id it is given, and the controller resolves whether the principal may see it.
