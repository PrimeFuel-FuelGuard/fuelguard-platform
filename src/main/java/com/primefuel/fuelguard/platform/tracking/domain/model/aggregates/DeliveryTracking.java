/**
 * The tracking projection of a delivery (S16/T16-A): the <em>latest trusted</em> position and the latest
 * load milestone. Frequent samples stay out of the {@code Delivery} aggregate; this projection reduces their
 * interface to a single consultable row, while every raw sample is kept separately and referenced by id.
 *
 * <p>Its central invariant is the one inherited from S16: <strong>a late sample never regresses the
 * latest</strong>. {@link #recordPosition} advances the projection only when the observation is strictly
 * newer than the current one; a late (or tied) sample returns {@code false}, so the caller can persist it as
 * raw evidence without moving the latest. The load milestone guards that an {@code UNLOADED} cannot precede a
 * {@code LOADED}.
