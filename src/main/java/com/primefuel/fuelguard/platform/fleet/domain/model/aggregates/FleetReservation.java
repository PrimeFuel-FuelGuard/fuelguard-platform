/**
 * An exclusive hold on a driver + tanker over a {@link ReservationWindow} at a requested {@link Volume}
 * (S13). Its invariants: same tenant, positive volume, a valid window, and no overlap against an existing
 * active reservation of the same resource. The window/volume are modeled on the shared {@code Unit}/{@code
 * Volume} over the legacy {@code Double} (U05), with no decimal migration.
 *
 * <p>The optimistic-lock {@code version} and the {@code reference} idempotency key are wired here; the
 * concurrent barrier that makes two races resolve to one winner (T13-B) lives in the service, and the two
 * terminal transitions off {@code ACTIVE} are {@link #release()} and {@link #expireIfPast(Instant)}.
