 * A driver-app position sample was received for a delivery (S16). Event type {@code

 * of a telemetry consumer). {@code latestAdvanced} distinguishes a sample that moved the projection's latest
 * position from a late one that is only preserved as raw evidence — a late sample still emits the event
 * (it <em>was</em> received), it just does not regress the projection.
