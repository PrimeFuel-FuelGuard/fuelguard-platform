/**
 * The S15/T15-A assignment orchestrator, public entry point. It lives in {@code applicationflows} — the
 * composition root — and unites acceptance, reservations and delivery behind public seams:
 * {@code ConsumeAcceptance} → {@code ReserveSupply} → {@code ReserveFleet} → create the assigned delivery.
 *
 * <p>All the work (and the single local transaction) happens in {@link AssignDeliveryExecutor}; this class
 * only adapts the executor's throw-to-rollback signal back into a {@code Result}, so callers get an
 * {@link ApplicationError} (mapped to the right HTTP status by the controller) while the transaction is
 * guaranteed to have rolled back everything on failure.
 *
 * <p>Assigning is not starting: the delivery is created in {@code ASSIGNED}; the physical machine (T14-A)
 * owns start/arrive/complete. The acceptance behind the order must be {@code ACCEPTED} and is consumed
 * <em>once</em>; a retry with the same {@code commandId} returns the same delivery.
