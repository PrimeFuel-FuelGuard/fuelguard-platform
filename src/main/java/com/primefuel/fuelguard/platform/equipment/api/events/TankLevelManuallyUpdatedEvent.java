 * Public contract of the equipment module: published when a tank level is edited manually (the legacy

 * without depending on the frozen IoT telemetry/devicebinding infrastructure.
 *
 * @param sourceKey a deterministic identity for this manual edit ({@code manual:<epochMilli>}), used for
 *                  dedup and to seed the idempotent episode key.
