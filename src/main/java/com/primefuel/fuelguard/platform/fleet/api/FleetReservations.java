/**
 * Write seam for fleet reservations (S13/T13-A/B). Nothing outside the {@code fleet} module may hold a
 * driver or a tanker directly; this is the only public write surface for a temporal reservation.
 *
 * <p>{@link #reserve} models the window/volume, checks capacity and revalidates overlap against existing
 * active reservations while holding a {@code PESSIMISTIC_WRITE} lock on the reserved resources (U06), so
 * two callers racing for the same resource serialise to one winner and one {@code 409}. It is idempotent
 * by the caller's {@code reference} (A3): a replay returns the same reservation, a mismatching replay is a
 * {@code 409}. {@link #release} and {@link #expireOverdue} close the lifecycle (A2).
 *
 * <p>No REST endpoint is exposed (A1): the reservation is consumed in-process by the fleet's next
 * consumer, so callers — never a request body — must supply {@code providerId} resolved from
 * {@code iam.api.TenantAccess} (A4).
