 * Public contract of the telemetry module: published when a reading is normalised and attributed to a

 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code telemetry.api.events} (not in the module's {@code domain}) so other modules can
 * react to it without reaching into telemetry internals — the refill policy (S09) is the first external
 * consumer.
